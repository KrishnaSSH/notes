### **Stoichiometry**

### What is Stoichiometry?

Stoichiometry is about using balanced chemical equations to figure out how much of each substance is involved in a chemical reaction.

### Steps to Understand Stoichiometry

1. **Balanced Chemical Equation**:
    
    - A balanced equation shows the reactants (what you start with) and products (what you end up with) in a reaction.
    - Example: For the combustion of hydrogen: 2H2​+O2​→2H2​O
    - This means 2 molecules of hydrogen react with 1 molecule of oxygen to produce 2 molecules of water.
2. **Moles**:
    
    - A mole is a way to count particles (like atoms or molecules). One mole equals 6.022×1023 particles.
    - You can convert grams to moles using the formula: $$
\text{Moles} = \frac{\text{Mass (grams)}}{\text{Molarmass (grams per mole)}}
$$

3. **Using Ratios**:
    
    - From the balanced equation, you can find ratios of reactants and products.
    - For example, from the equation above, the ratio of H2​ to H2​O is 2:2 (or 1:1).
4. **Finding Amounts**:
    
    - If you know how much of one substance you have, you can find out how much of another substance you need or will produce.
    - Example: If you have 4 moles of H2​:
        - Using the ratio from the equation, you will produce 4 moles of H2​O.
5. **Limiting Reagent**:
    
    - Sometimes, you don’t have enough of one reactant to use all of another. The one that runs out first is called the limiting reagent.
    - To find it, calculate how much product each reactant can produce and see which one produces less.

### Simple Example Problem

**Question**: How much water can be made from 10 grams of hydrogen?

1. **Balanced Equation**: 2H2​+O2​→2H2​O
    
2. **Calculate Moles of H2​**:
    
    - Molar mass of H2​ = 2 g/mol Moles of H2​=2 g/mol10 g​=5 moles
3. **Use the Ratio**:
    
    - From the equation, 2 moles of H2​ produce 2 moles of H2​O.
    - So, 5 moles of H2​ will produce 5 moles of H2​O.
4. **Convert Moles of Water to Grams**:
    
    - Molar mass of H2​O = 18 g/mol Mass of H2​O=5 moles×18 g/mol=90 g
